What I've done for page speed optimisation:
1. Added async js loading.
2. Added CSS loading through JS.
3. Compressed images.
4. Removed unused CSS rules.
5. Moved JS code from the head to the bottom of the body.

What I've done for FPS optimisation:
1. Moved style properties from code to CSS.
2. Avoided access to DOM object in the loops.
3. Avoided multiple recalculations in the loops.
4. Cached dom elements in an array.
5. Added CSS properties to enable hardware optimisation for some elements(mover).
