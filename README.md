What I've done for page speed optimisation:
* Added async js loading.
* Added CSS loading through JS.
* Compressed images.
* Removed unused CSS rules.
* Moved JS code from the head to the bottom of the body.

What I've done for FPS optimisation:
* Moved style properties from code to CSS.
* Avoided access to DOM object in the loops.
* Avoided multiple recalculations in the loops.
* Cached dom elements in an array.
* Added CSS properties to enable hardware optimisation for some elements(mover).
